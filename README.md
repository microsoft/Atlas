# Atlas

Atlas is a tool for automating the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of DevOps engineering 
systems. An Atlas workflow revolves around making the appropriate REST API calls to VSTS, 
Active Directory, and Azure Resource Manager. It can be run interactively from the command line, 
or can be run entirely unattended as part of a VSTS build or release defintion.

There is a REST API for everything. With Atlas you can make the configuration of everything from CI/CD to
production consistent, reproducable, and reviewable by capturing them as source controlled templates.
