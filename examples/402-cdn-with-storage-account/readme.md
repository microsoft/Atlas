## Atlas release publishing workflow

Performs the following actions

* Creates or updates a blob storage account and associated CDN

* Uploads latest build binary files to blob storage

* Creates or updates `latest.json` with the current version information

* Writes out `sleet-push.sh` and `sleet-push.cmd` script files

The release pipeline is expected to execute the sleet-push script file, which will push the latest nuget 
packages to the storage account. That storage account acts as a static-file NuGet feed.

## To run locally

Create a `values.yaml` in a working directory with at least the following information:
```
azure:
  tenant: <GUID> or <TENANT.onmicrosoft.com>
  subscription: <GUID>

vsts:
  account: <ACCOUNTNAME> # the part appears in the https://<ACCOUNTNAME>.visualstudio.com
```

Run the following command 
`atlas deploy path/to/examples/401-linux-agent-pool --set vsts.token=[PAT]`

See the `examples/401-linux-agent-pool/values.yaml` for other settings you would want to override.

### API references

This workflow uses the Azure REST API to create a Resource Group and Azure Resource Manager deployment,
and the Storage REST API to list keys in order to upload files.
